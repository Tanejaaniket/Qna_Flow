#### Important notes about the project 
- Project uses Appwrite as Baas(Backend as a service) which is similar to Firebase.
- Project uses acerenity, magic ui, shadcn for UI.
- Project uses zustand for state management. Zustand is basically useContext hook on steroids.
- Along with zustand immer is used for immutability. You know we can't directly change the object declared as state but using immer it is possible.
- We also you persist (part of zustand) for saving states in local storage.
